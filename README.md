### 6.6 vim-gutentags

generate tags for you in project in ~/.cache/tags, and add it to tags path in vim

`ctags` is needed.

### 6.7 ctrlsf

`ripgrep` is needed for this plugin.

1. Run `:CtrlSF [pattern]`, it will split a new window to show search result.

2. If you are doing an asynchronous searching, you can explore and edit other files in the meanwhile, and can always press `Ctrl-C` to stop searching.

3. In the result window, press `Enter`/`o` to open corresponding file, or press `q` to quit.

4. Press `p` to explore file in a preview window if you only want a glance.

5. You can edit search result as you like. Whenever you apply a change, you can save your change to actual file by `:w`.

6. If you change your mind after saving, you can always undo it by pressing `u` and saving it again.

7. `:CtrlSFOpen` can reopen CtrlSF window when you have closed CtrlSF window. It is free because it won't invoke a same but new search. A handy command `:CtrlSFToggle` is also available.

8. If you prefer a quickfix-like result window, just try to press `M` in CtrlSF window.

## 7. Have fun
You are welcome to PR.

<!-- ## ATTENTION -->
<!-- Because of the version dependance config file for tmux, `bc` need to be installed. -->
